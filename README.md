# Run Your Own Private AI Chatbot Locally

## 🔐 Why Private AI Matters

Using AI locally means **you control your data** — no third-party cloud, no leaks, no surveillance.  
Whether you're working on confidential projects, testing red team tactics, or just value privacy, a local AI setup ensures **full autonomy** over inputs and outputs.

## 📘 Want to Set It Up Yourself?

I’ve documented the full setup — step-by-step — with screenshots and explanations.  
You’ll learn how to use:

- Ollama (to run LLMs like LLaMA 3 locally)
- OpenWebUI (a GUI for your AI)
- Docker (for containerized, clean setup)
